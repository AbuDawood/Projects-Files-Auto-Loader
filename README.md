# Projects-Files-Auto-Loader
click right on any project's directory and then click on enable/disable watch. The first click is to enable the auto-include watcher and the next is to disable it. You can notice this by changes performed on the json config file. We recommand to use this method to include and exclude directories. while the direct edit of the json config is watchable we do not recommend it except on setting extentions types. and you have to follow the same format and writting style to update the autogenerated format
